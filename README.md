  - Pitch accuracy and scale adherence
  - Rhythm precision and timing consistency
  - Dynamic expression and velocity variations
  
- **Specific Error Detection**
  - Identifies notes outside the musical key
  - Highlights unusual note durations
  - Detects inconsistent dynamics

- **Interactive Visualizations**
  - Pitch distribution graphs
  - Performance timeline visualization
  - Color-coded error identification

- **AI-Powered Feedback**
  - Generates personalized, constructive feedback
  - Highlights strengths and areas for improvement
  - Provides actionable suggestions for practice

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Python, Flask
- **Analysis**: Music21, Mido, NumPy, SciKit-Learn
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI API
- **Visualization**: Plotly
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

##  Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- OpenAI API key
- Python packages listed in requirements.txt

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/music-performance-analyzer.git
   cd music-performance-analyzer
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Create a `.env` file with your OpenAI API key:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

5. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

6. Access the web interface at `http://localhost:5000`

## üìä How It Works

1. **Upload MIDI File**: Submit a MIDI recording of your musical performance
2. **Analysis**: The application analyzes pitch, rhythm, and dynamics
3. **Error Detection**: Specific performance errors are identified and categorized
4. **Visualization**: Interactive graphs illustrate performance characteristics
5. **AI Feedback**: Personalized coaching feedback is generated based on the analysis
